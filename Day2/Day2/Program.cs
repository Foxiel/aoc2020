// TODO:
// Split array item into 3 parts 1 being the numbers, 1 being the letter it is supposed to find and 1 being the row of letters

// 1. Put the amount of times that the letter appears in the last string to a variable
// 2. Split the first array into 2 seperate variables 
// 3. Compare the 2 separate variables with the amount of times that it is valid
// 4. If it is valid, do valid++
// 5. write valid to the console
